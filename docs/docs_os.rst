.. module:: os

****************
Operating System
****************

This module implements a generic os interface.
To function correctly it needs a filesystem to be mounted, so that the module can use
the driver to access the underlying hardware.

.. note:: Every path needed as argument for an os function must follow chosen driver path convention. File/Directory access error due to low-level failure will raise an OSError.

    
.. function:: exists(path)

    Return True if path refers to an existing path, False otherwise.

    
.. function:: isdir(path)

    Return True if path is an existing directory, False otherwise.

    
.. function:: remove(path)

    Remove (delete) the file path. If path is a directory, OSError is raised; see :func:`rmdir` below to remove a directory.

    
.. function:: rmdir(path)

    Remove (delete) the directory path. Only works when the directory is empty, otherwise, OSError is raised.

    
.. function:: rename(src_path, dst_path)

    Rename the file or directory src_path to dst_path. If dst_path is a directory, OSError will be raised.

    
.. function:: mkdir(path)

    Create a directory named path.

    
.. function:: chdir(path)

    Change the current working directory to path.

    
.. function:: getcwd()

    Return a string representing the current working directory.

    Since C filesystem drivers need a limit on returned string length::

        os.cwd_max_length

    attribute is set to 128 by default but can be adjusted, if needed, before calling :meth:`getcwd`.
    
.. function:: listdir(path)

    Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path. The list is in arbitrary order.
    It does not include the special entries '.' and '..' even if they are present in the directory.

    
.. function:: copyfile(src, dst)

    Copy the contents of the file named src to a file named dst.

    
================
The FileIO class
================

.. class:: FileIO(path, mode = 'r')

    Main class to handle files.

        * path is a string (following chosen low-level filesystem driver format)
        * mode is a string:

            * 'r'       open for reading (default)
            * 'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
            * 'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
            * 'b'       binary mode
            * '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
    
.. method:: read(n_bytes = -1)

        Read up to size bytes from the object and return them. As a convenience, if size is unspecified or -1, the whole file is read.
        Return type can be string or bytes depending on chosen mode.

        An empty string or an empty bytes object indicate end of file.

        
.. method:: write(to_w, sync = False)

        Write to_w object (string or bytes) to the stream and return the number of characters written.

        *sync* parameter allows to write changes to disk immediately, without waiting :meth:`close` call.
        
.. method:: close()

        Close file stream.
        
.. method:: size()

        Return file size.
        
.. method:: tell()

        Return the current stream position.
        
.. method:: seek(offset, whence=0)

        Move the current position to *offset* bytes with respect to *whence*.

        *whence* can be:

            * 0: start of file
            * 1: current position
            * 2: end of file

        
.. method:: truncate()

        Resize the stream to the given size in bytes (or the current position if size is not specified).
        The current stream position isnâ€™t changed.
        
.. method:: readline()

        Read until newline or EOF and return a single str.
        If the stream is already at EOF, an empty string is returned.

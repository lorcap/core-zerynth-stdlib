SpiSD
*****

This module handles operations on Standard Capacity and High Capacity SD Cards (SDSC, SDHC) through Spi protocol.
The following operations are allowed:

    * read/write single block, with block address specified through SDSC or SDHC convention;
    * read/write multiple blocks, with block address specified through SDSC or SDHC convention;
    * generic read/write data, with block address specified through SDHC convention for both SDCS and SDHC cards;
    * read cid register.

Block size is set by default to 512 bytes.

Address conventions:

    * SDSC convention allows to select a block through its first byte location in byte address (example: for a block size of 512 bytes, second block will be addressed 0x200);
    * SDHC convention allows to select a block through its block address (example: 2nd block address (starting from 0th block) is simply 0x2)

SpiSD class
===========

.. class:: SpiSD(drvname, cs, clock=1000000)

        Initialize an SD card specifying its:

            * MCU SPI circuitry *drvname* (one of SPI0, SPI1, ... check pinmap for details);
            * chip select pin *cs*;
            * clock *clock*, default at 1MHz

        The instance attribute *hc* is set to 1 if the card is recognized as an SDHC, to 0 otherwise.

    
.. method:: single_block_read(addr)

        Read a single block at address *addr*, following SDSC or SDHC address convention depending on used card.

        
.. method:: multiple_blocks_read(addr, n)

        Read n blocks starting from address *addr*, following SDSC or SDHC address convention depending on used card.

        
.. method:: read_data(addr, n)

        Read n blocks starting from address *addr*, SDHC address convention is used.

        
.. method:: single_block_write(addr, data)

        Write a single block at address *addr*, following SDSC or SDHC address convention depending on used card.
        *data* must be a 512-byte long bytearray.

        
.. method:: multiple_blocks_write(addr, data)

        Write *data* starting from address *addr*, following SDSC or SDHC address convention depending on used card.

        Two formats allowed for *data*:

            * bytearray with a len multiple of 512 bytes.
            * list of 512-byte long bytearrays, where each bytearray inside data list contains data for a single block::

                block_1 = bytearray(0x200)
                block_2 = bytearray(0x200)
                ...
                [ block_1 , block_2 , ... ]

        
.. method:: write_data(addr, data)

        Write *data* starting from address *addr*, SDHC address convention is used.

        *data* format is defined as in :meth:`multiple_blocks_write` .

        
.. method:: read_cid()

        Read 16-byte long cid register value.

.. module:: dac

***
DAC
***

This module loads the DAC (Digital Analog Converter) interface.
A digital to analog converter is a module to convert digital values into analog ones.

While builtin analogWrite *simulates* an analog value through the PWM peripheral, DAC output is a pure analog one.
This means higher accuracy, specially with high speed signals.

Example::

    import streams
    import adc # for analogRead

    import dac


    def readInput():
        while True:
            print("reading A1: ",analogRead(A1))
            sleep(500)

    streams.serial()
    pinMode(A1,INPUT)
    # read input in a separate thread
    thread(readInput)

    my_dac = dac.DAC(D8.DAC)
    my_dac.start()

    my_dac.write([100,200,900,800],1000,MILLIS,circular=True)

The DAC class

.. class:: DAC(pin)

        Creates a DAC instance on *pin* pin (look at board pinmap to see which pins are enabled for using the DAC peripheral).

    
.. method:: start()

        DAC is started. It is necessary to start the driver before writing any value.

        
.. method:: write(data, timestep, timeunit, circular=False)

        *data* is output on selected pin.

        *data* parameter can be:

            * a single integer value::

                my_dac.write(666)

            * a list of values to be output every *timestep* *timeunit*econds until the end of the list is reached and last value is kept on output::

                my_dac.write([555,666,777],500,MILLIS)
                # one sample every 500 MILLISeconds

            * a list of values to be output every *timestep* *timeunit*econds, restarting from the beginning as soon as the end of the list is reached, until write method is called again::

                my_dac.write([555,666,777],500,MILLIS,circular=True)

        
.. method:: stop()

        dac is stopped and low level configuration disabled.

        
.. method:: lock()

        Locks the driver. It is useful when the same dac object is used by multiple threads to avoid interferences.

        
.. method:: unlock()

        Unlocks the driver. It is useful when the same dac object is used by multiple threads to avoid interferences.

        
.. function:: remap(values,lowflex=660,highflex=3415)

    Some DAC chips have a limited voltage range (i.e. Sam3X by Atmel maps from ~3.3/6 V to ~3.3*(5/6) V) and remap given output values according to their operative ranges.
    This helper function allows the user to obtain the voltage value he would expect from a proportional DAC.

    Given a *value* in *values* list, DAC output will respect the following formula::

        output_voltage = board_voltage * (value/4096)

    Each *value* in the list must be an integer between *lowflex* and *highflex* in order to avoid a TypeError exception.

    *lowflex* and *highflex* default values are set to the correct values for Sam3X mcu.

.. module:: hwtimers

***************
Hardware Timers
***************

This module implements the interface to the hardware timers of the board, allowing a greater precision in time measuring or time constrained tasks.

Currently, only the sleep_micros function is implemented
        
.. function:: sleep_micros(n)

    Suspend the current thread for *n* microseconds by using the functionalities of an high precision
    hardware timer. Currently, sleep_micros is not thread safe, and can't be called simultaneously by more than one thread.

    The actual amount of microseconds between the call and return of sleep_micros is usually greater than *n* due to the overhead of calling,
    returning and thread switching.

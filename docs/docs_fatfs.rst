.. module:: fatfs

fatFS

This module implements Zerynth binding to `FatFS C library <http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html>`_ to handle FAT disks.

======
Driver

.. function:: mount(path, args)

    Register/unregister a file system object to the fatFs module.
    There is no activity of the physical drive in this function: physical mount process will be attempted during first file access.

    Required arguments are:

        * path string, following FatFS path convention::

            path = "0:/" # to mount your drive as volume 0

            generic_file_path = "0:/my/file/path"


        * args dictionary containing disk initialization parameters::

            # correct format for SD Card read through SPI protocol
            args = {"drv": SPI0, "cs": D25, "clock": 1000000}

            # correct format for SD Card read through SD mode
            # (be careful in choosing frequency (kHz) and bits supported by your board)
            args = {"drv": SD0, "freq_khz": 20000, "bits": 1}

File/Directory Access/Management
================================

File/Directory access/management is handled by os module, which needs a filesystem to be mounted
and a list of low-level functions implemented in the filesystem module.

        * __f_size
        * __f_tell
        * __f_truncate
        * __f_eof

    * Directory Access

        * __f_opendir
        * __f_closedir
        * __f_readdir
